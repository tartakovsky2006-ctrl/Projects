# What's Happening Here?

Hi! This file explains what all this stuff is, in plain language. No tech background needed.

## What is this folder?

This folder (`Projects`) is your workspace. Think of it like a filing cabinet — each folder inside it is a separate project (like a separate drawer). You can have as many projects as you want, and they all live here together.

## What is Git?

Git is like a "save history" system for files. You know how Google Docs lets you go back and see older versions of a document? Git does that for entire folders of files.

Every time you make a meaningful change, you "save" it with a short note about what changed. These saves are called **commits**. If something breaks, you can always go back to an earlier save.

Git lives invisibly inside a hidden folder called `.git` — you never need to touch it.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website that stores a copy of your project on the internet. Think of it like Google Drive but specifically designed for projects that use Git.

Why use it?
- **Backup** — if your computer breaks, your work is safe online
- **Access anywhere** — you can see your files from any computer
- **Sharing** — if you ever want to show someone your work, you send them a link

Your projects live at: https://github.com/tartakovsky2006-ctrl

## What are all these weird files?

| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `to_learn.md` | Your personal list of things to learn |
| `WHATS_HAPPENING.md` | This file! The explainer you're reading right now |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Instructions for Claude (the AI assistant) so it knows how this project works |
| `.gitignore` | A list of files Git should ignore (like temporary junk files). You'll never need to edit this |

Files and folders that start with a dot (`.`) are hidden by default. That's normal — they're just behind-the-scenes configuration.

## What is a Terminal?

A terminal is a text-based way to talk to your computer. Instead of clicking buttons and icons, you type commands. It looks like a black or white window with text.

You don't need to use the terminal yourself — Claude handles that for you. But if you see references to "running a command" or "the command line," that's what it means.

## What is Code?

Code is just text that tells a computer what to do. It's written in files, just like any document, but instead of being meant for humans to read, it's meant for computers to follow.

Different **programming languages** are like different human languages — they all accomplish similar things but look different. Some common ones you might hear about:
- **Python** — popular, reads almost like English
- **JavaScript** — makes websites interactive
- **HTML/CSS** — defines what websites look like

## What does "build" or "run" mean?

When someone says they "run" code, it means they tell the computer to actually follow the instructions in the code files. When they "build" something, they're turning the code into a finished product (like turning a recipe into a meal).

## How does Claude fit into all this?

Claude (that's me, the AI you're chatting with) acts as your developer. You tell me what you want in plain English, and I:
1. Write the code
2. Organize the files
3. Save everything with Git
4. Push it to GitHub

You don't need to understand any of the technical details. Just describe what you want, and I'll handle the rest.
